            As an MFI, CYRUS was formed with the purpose of providing social and
            financial solutions to the poor. To determine its vulnerability to
            credit risk, there is review of the policies and procedures at every
            stage in the lending process to determine whether they reduce
            delinquencies and loan losses to an acceptable level.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 md:text-xl leading-loose text-gray-600">
            These policies and procedures include the loan eligibility criteria,
            the application review process and authorization levels, collateral
            or security requirements, as well as the ‚Äúcarrots and sticks‚Äù used
            to motivate staff and compel borrowers to repay.
